## Technical Documentation: Group Management and Activity Monitoring System (Updated)

### 1\. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for a web application designed to manage groups and monitor the daily activity of children participating in organized off-site events (e.g., camps, excursions, holiday trips). The primary goal of this application is to enhance child safety by systematically controlling their numbers at all stages of a trip.

### 2\. Stakeholders

  * **Administrator:** The main responsible party who receives information from Betreuers and monitors the overall number of children. The Administrator is alerted in case of discrepancies in child counts.
  * **Betreuer (Supervisor):** Staff members responsible for individual groups of children (approximately 10 children per group). Each Betreuer is assigned to a specific group, performs recounts, and submits data to the Administrator via the application.

### 3\. System Overview

The system provides a simplified method for collecting and displaying summarized group information. It supports:

  * **Staff Registration:** Betreuers can log in to a specific group for the current day, providing their name.
  * **Child Count Tracking:** The system records the number of children present in each group for the current day.
  * **Administrative Oversight:** Administrators have a consolidated view of all groups, including assigned Betreuers and child counts, with activity tracking and automatic data updates.

### 4\. System Structure and Organization

  * **Total Children:** Approximately 150 children, divided into 15 groups.
  * **Group Size:** Each group consists of approximately 10 children.
  * **Group Tracking:** Each group is tracked individually and is assigned a Betreuer. Recounts are performed at each movement point.

### 5\. Workflow

The application supports a continuous monitoring process throughout the event:

  * **Before Departure:**
      * Betreuers count children in their groups before boarding the bus.
      * The count is submitted to the Administrator via the application, setting the `KinderAnzahl` for their group for the day.
  * **Upon Arrival:**
      * A recount is performed upon disembarking the bus.
      * Betreuers submit the data again, updating `KinderAnzahlNow`.
  * **Evening / End of Day:**
      * A final recount of all children is performed.
      * Data is reconciled with the morning's `KinderAnzahl`.
      * In case of discrepancies (`KinderAnzahl` \!= `KinderAnzahlNow`), the Administrator receives an alarm signal (visual highlight) and can view information on missing children and their Betreuers. The "search process" itself is outside the scope of this application.

### 6\. Technical Requirements

  * **Target Audience:** German-speaking staff responsible for child safety during group events.
  * **Platform:** Exclusively adapted for use on Android and iOS mobile phones.
  * **Language:** User interface must be in German.
  * **User Experience:** User-friendly and adapted UI for smartphone screens, ensuring ease of use for all participants, including non-technical individuals.

### 7\. Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** Provides the foundational structure for all web pages.
  * **CSS (Bootstrap 5.3.3):** Utilized for a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface, including styling for forms, buttons, tables, navigation, and spinners.
  * **JavaScript (Vue.js 3):** A progressive framework for frontend development, enabling:
      * **Data Binding:** Automatic synchronization between the data model and the view.
      * **Event Handling:** Responding to user interactions (e.g., button clicks, data input).
      * **State Management:** Efficient client-side application data management.
      * **Dynamic Content Updates:** Updating parts of the page without full reloads.
  * **Deployment:** The application is distributed as a website link, which can be presented as a QR code for convenience.
  * **Hosting:** Hosted via GitHub ([https://github.com/alex-lysenko-de/stadtranderholung.git](https://github.com/alex-lysenko-de/stadtranderholung.git)).

### 8\. Application Modules (File Names)

The project comprises three core HTML files and two additional files for future extensions, each with distinct functionalities:

#### 8.1. `login.html`

  * **Purpose:** The entry point for Betreuers. Users input the current date, their name (Betreuer), and group number.
  * **Functionality:**
      * Automatically sets the current date in the input field.
      * Saves the Betreuer's name in the browser's local storage for future convenience.
      * Sends Betreuer assignment data to the central JSON storage (JSONBin.io), linking the Betreuer to a specific group for the current day.
      * Upon successful data submission, redirects the user to `group.html`, passing the group number as a URL parameter.

#### 8.2. `group.html`

  * **Purpose:** Designed for interacting with a specific group's data.
  * **Functionality:**
      * Automatically determines the group number from the URL parameters (`?gr=X`) used for redirection from `login.html`.
      * Allows the Betreuer to input the initial number of children present in the group for the current morning (`KinderAnzahl`). This value is set once at the beginning of the day and represents the number of children received from parents, and is expected to be the number returned.
      * Allows the Betreuer to recalculate and enter the number of children at the current moment (`KinderAnzahlNow`). This value can be updated multiple times throughout the day.
      * Sends the entered child counts (`KinderAnzahl` and `KinderAnzahlNow`) to the JSON storage.
      * Displays a list of all Betreuers already assigned to this group for the current day.
      * Includes "Liste der Kinder bearbeiten" (Edit Children List) and "Rechnen" (Calculate) buttons.

#### 8.3. `admin_overview.html`

  * **Purpose:** Provides Administrators with a centralized overview of all groups and their current status.
  * **Functionality:**
      * Loads and displays summarized information for all groups in an interactive table.
      * **Initial State Handling:**
          * Upon opening, the page queries JSONBin.io for data for the current date.
          * If no data is found (meaning no Betreuer has logged in yet for the day), only the "Recount Children" button is displayed.
          * After clicking "Recount Children," if data is still absent, an empty list is displayed.
          * The page then automatically refreshes every 10 seconds to show the current status.
      * **Total Child Count Display:** Prominently displays the total number of children across all groups for `KinderAnzahl` (morning count) and `KinderAnzahlNow` (current count) at the very beginning of the page. If these two values do not match, the discrepancy should be highlighted in red, along with information on how many children are absent, in which groups, and the names of the children and their Betreuers.
      * **"Recount Children" Button:**
          * A large button at the top of the page.
          * **Functionality (Proposed):** Clicking this button triggers a call to JSONBin.io to set all `KinderAnzahlNow` values for the current day to `null` for all groups. This signals Betreuers to perform a new recount.
          * **User Experience (Proposed):** While a recount is active, the button's text should change to "Stop Recount" or display a loading indicator, and the table might show spinners for `KinderAnzahlNow` values, indicating data is pending.
      * For each group, displays: group number, `KinderAnzahl` (morning count), `KinderAnzahlNow` (current recount, if available), and a list of assigned Betreuers for the current day.
      * **Status Visualization:** Groups for which data (e.g., `KinderAnzahl` or `Betreuer` list) has not yet been entered are displayed in gray, indicating an "inactive" status for the current day.
      * **Loading Indicator:** If the `KinderAnzahlNow` for a group is unknown (data is absent/null), a spinner with the message "Berechnung l√§uft..." (Calculation in progress...) is displayed, simulating data retrieval.
      * **Periodic Update:** The page automatically polls JSONBin.io every 10 seconds to retrieve the latest data and update the display in real-time, ensuring information accuracy without manual page reloads.
      * **Navigation:** Each group number in the table serves as a link to navigate to the `group.html` page for that specific group using the URL parameter `group.html?gr=X` (e.g., `group.html?gr=1`).

#### 8.4. `group_edit.html` (Future Extension - Initial Implementation Required)

  * **Purpose:** To manage the list of individual children within a group.
  * **Functionality:**
      * Accessed via the "Liste der Kinder bearbeiten" button on `group.html`.
      * Displays a list of all children in the group, stored in local storage.
      * Includes "Add a child" and "Remove a child" buttons.
      * **Minimal Implementation:** In the initial phase, this page can be a simple HTML structure with headings and placeholder buttons, without full functionality, to satisfy the requirement for its existence.

#### 8.5. `group_calc.html` (Future Extension - Initial Implementation Required)

  * **Purpose:** To facilitate the detailed recount of children within a group.
  * **Functionality:**
      * Accessed via the "Rechnen" button on `group.html`.
      * Displays a list of all children in the group, stored in local storage.
      * Includes checkboxes next to each child's name, labeled "anwesend" (present).
      * **Minimal Implementation:** Similar to `group_edit.html`, this can be a simple HTML structure with headings, a list of placeholder children, and checkboxes, without full functionality, for the initial phase.

### 9\. JSON Data Storage Service

  * **Service:** JSONBin.io is used as the cloud-based JSON data storage service. It provides a simple RESTful API for storing, retrieving, and updating JSON documents, suitable for small projects and prototypes.

### 10\. JSON Data Structure

Data in JSONBin.io is stored as a single root JSON object, organized by date. Each date contains information about the groups active on that day.

**Example Structure:**

```json
{
  "YYYY-MM-DD": { // Key: Date in "Year-Month-Day" format
    "groups": {
      "1": { // Key: Group number (string)
        "Betreuer": [ // Array of names of staff assigned to this group
          "Name_Employee_1",
          "Name_Employee_2"
        ],
        "KinderAnzahl": 15, // Number of children in the group for this date (morning count)
        "KinderAnzahlNow": 15 // Number of children in the group after recalculation (current count)
      },
      "2": {
        "Betreuer": [
          "Name_Employee_3"
        ],
        "KinderAnzahl": 10,
        "KinderAnzahlNow": 9 // (!) 10 - 9 = 1 child is lost; administrator needs to be informed
      },
      "3": {
        "Betreuer": [], // Empty array if no Betreuer assigned
        "KinderAnzahl": null, // null if child count not specified
        "KinderAnzahlNow": null
      },
      "4": {
        "Betreuer": ["Name_Employee_4"],
        "KinderAnzahl": 10,
        "KinderAnzahlNow": null // Recalculation data not yet received, but likely to be soon
      }
      // ... other groups with their data
    }
  },
  "YYYY-MM-DD_another_date": {
    "groups": {
      // ... data for another date
    }
  }
  // ... other entries for other dates
}
```

**Structure Explanation:**

  * **Root Object:** Container for all data. Keys are dates in "YYYY-MM-DD" format (e.g., "2025-07-26").
  * **Date Object:** For each specific date, a nested object with the key "groups" is contained.
  * **Groups Object:** Contains a set of keys, each representing a string version of the group number (e.g., "1", "2", "15").
  * **Group Object:** For each group on a specific date, three fields are stored:
      * **`Betreuer` (Array of Strings):** An array containing the names (strings) of all staff who have "logged in" to this group on the specified date. Can be empty if no one has logged in.
      * **`KinderAnzahl` (Number or `null`):** A numerical value representing the number of children registered in this group for this date (morning count). This value is expected to be set once at the start of the day and remain constant. Can be `null` if the initial child count has not been entered.
      * **`KinderAnzahlNow` (Number or `null`):** The actual number of children currently available, obtained as a result of a recount during the day. This figure may differ from `KinderAnzahl`, typically downwards. When the Administrator clicks the "recount children" button, this value is reset to `null` for all groups, prompting Betreuers to initiate a recount. By comparing `KinderAnzahl` and `KinderAnzahlNow`, the Administrator can determine if any children are missing or if all are present.

### 11\. JSONBin.io Access Information

  * **MASTER\_KEY:** `$2a$10$Yxp3iL9EqLkbpNRwKv0et.hXwFYAtyN3wkFpYhkyiCmD8riOLllqm`
  * **ACCESS\_KEY:** `$2a$10$25EbEOOZQFXGw/T2PkMKm.EELC/3G9sFCI7TNaAxpkawvjEUhAYCu`
  * **BIN\_ID:** `68834e6e7b4b8670d8a712d0` (This is the ID for Bin "Days" in Collection "SR2025")

### 12\. Proposed Technical Solutions for Unresolved Points

#### 12.1. "Recount Children" Button Functionality on `admin_overview.html`

  * **Action for Resetting `KinderAnzahlNow`:**

      * When the "Recount Children" button is clicked, the `admin_overview.html` frontend will perform a `PUT` request to JSONBin.io for the `BIN_ID` (representing the entire `Days` bin).
      * The `PUT` request will send the current JSON data structure, but with all `KinderAnzahlNow` values for the current day's groups explicitly set to `null`.
      * This approach requires fetching the entire bin, modifying the relevant part, and then sending the modified bin back. Given the "simple web application" nature, this is a pragmatic solution. For very large datasets, a more granular update mechanism would be needed, but for 15 groups, this should be acceptable.

  * **User Experience during Recount:**

      * **Button State:** When the "Recount Children" button is clicked, its text should immediately change to "Recount in Progress..." or "Stop Recount" and be disabled to prevent multiple clicks. A spinner icon could be added next to the text.
      * **Global Loading Indicator:** A small, unobtrusive loading spinner or message could appear at the top of the page (e.g., "Recount initiated. Waiting for Betreuers...") to indicate a global process.
      * **Table Display:** For each group in the table, the `KinderAnzahlNow` column should immediately show the "Berechnung l√§uft..." spinner until new data for that specific group is received through the 10-second polling.

#### 12.2. Error Handling and User Feedback

  * **General Approach:** Implement a simple alert or toast notification system (e.g., using Bootstrap's alert components or a lightweight notification library).
  * **Login Page (`login.html`):**
      * **Success:** Upon successful login and data submission, a brief "Anmeldung erfolgreich\!" (Login successful\!) message could appear before redirection.
      * **Error:** If data submission to JSONBin.io fails (e.g., network error, API issue), a prominent "Fehler bei der Anmeldung. Bitte versuchen Sie es erneut." (Error during login. Please try again.) message should be displayed.
  * **Group Page (`group.html`):**
      * **Success:** After submitting `KinderAnzahl` or `KinderAnzahlNow`, a small "Daten gespeichert\!" (Data saved\!) message.
      * **Error:** If data submission fails, an "Fehler beim Speichern der Daten." (Error saving data.) message.
  * **Admin Overview Page (`admin_overview.html`):**
      * **Success (Recount Initiation):** After successfully sending the reset command to JSONBin.io, a "Neuer Z√§hlvorgang gestartet\!" (New recount initiated\!) notification.
      * **Error (Recount Initiation):** If the reset command fails, an "Fehler beim Starten des Z√§hlvorgangs." (Error starting recount.) message.
      * **Data Loading Errors:** If polling JSONBin.io fails, a discreet "Datenaktualisierung fehlgeschlagen. Netzwerkproblem?" (Data refresh failed. Network issue?) message could appear without interrupting the user too much.

This updated documentation, including proposed solutions for the previously undefined points, should provide a solid foundation for development.
